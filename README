Hey hey, Read me first.
So if you are curious, I will explain to you.

So how is Nostr account deletion work?
Well, If you are asking about that, That was actually really simple.

You send metadata about your new profile, But you put "deleted: true" on it, like this:

{
  "name": "Yonle",
  "display_name": "Yonle",
  "about": "Self taught programmer from Indonesia",
  "website": "https://yonle.lecturify.net",
  "nip05": "yonle@yonle.lecturify.net",
  "lud16": "humidprocess01@walletofsatoshi.com",
  "deleted": true // <--- Here's the cause
}

So what was the project doing here is by sending Event Deletion event (or kind 5 event) about the conflicting event.

Alright. So that's all about how it works.
